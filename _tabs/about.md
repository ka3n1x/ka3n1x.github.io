## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me (ka3n1x) — aka  0x4n6

Known in the cyber arenas as **ka3n1x** or **0x4n6**, I’m driven by a passion for **CTFs**, **ethical hacking**, and deep system exploration. As captain of **M3V7R**, **ApeItek**, and former president of **Cybersec Epihack**, I’ve navigated both local and international competitions. 

Spoiler: we tend to do pretty well.

But more than just the thrill of the game or technical flexes, it’s the *quest for understanding* that fuels me—a nearly visceral need to dismantle mechanisms, analyze every gear, and rebuild them in my own way.

## 🧠 Interests

Curiosity is my default setting. I’m fascinated by how systems work—and even more by how they *break*. Reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and offensive security are more than hobbies; they’re ways to challenge assumptions and rethink the status quo.

I love exploring attack vectors, experimenting with social engineering, and testing security perimeters—not for chaos, but to expose blind spots and spark smarter defenses. To me, every new tool, protocol, or application is an open invitation to dig deeper, to see the world through the eyes of an adversary, and to constantly ask: "What if?"

Outside of digital frontlines, I geek out on tech news, puzzles, mental models, and anything that sharpens creative problem-solving. Always learning, always iterating, always one step ahead.

I occasionally train my hacking muscles on:

- **Hack The Box**
- **BTLO**
- **Root Me**
- **HackRopoll**

Feel free to check out my profiles and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
