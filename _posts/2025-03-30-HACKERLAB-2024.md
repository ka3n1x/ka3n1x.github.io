### **‚ö°What is HackerLab?**

HackerLab is Benin‚Äôs national cybersecurity showdown, a thrilling "Capture The Flag" (CTF) competition orchestrated by the Agency for Information Systems and Digital (ASIN). Since its inception in 2017, HackerLab has served as the ultimate proving ground for cybersecurity talent across the nation, challenging participants in areas such as forensics, steganography, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, web security, cryptography and programming. This epic arena not only identifies but nurtures cybersecurity heroes destined for greatness.

Winners of HackerLab receive various rewards, including training and certification kits, unlimited internet access, and gift vouchers. 

HackerLab is part of Benin's national digital security strategy and also serves as a talent pool for recruitment into the bjCSIRT (the Beninese government‚Äôs Computer Security Incident Response Team) and the Digital Investigations Laboratory, as well as the private sector.

I highly recommend reading my article on the [Hackerlab 2023](https://ka3n1x.io/posts/HACKERLAB-2023) before continuing with this one. 

### **My Journey to HackerLab Glory**

#### Chapter 1: A Champion Rises

On September 6, 2024, I entered the battlefield of the HackerLab 2024 Finals at the Palais des Congr√®s, Cotonou. Under the handles ka3n1x, I was no stranger to the heat of this ctf, I‚Äôd already faced the fray with team M3V7R in the previous edition. This year, I returned, battle-hardened and more determined than ever.

#### Chapter 2: Trials of the Qualifiers

June 2024. The month where sleep became a memory and every night turned into a battlefield. The qualifiers stretched over weeks, but every day felt like its own war‚Äîa relentless grind that tested my endurance, patience, and willpower. The sheer weight of the unexpected scheduling and the workload was intense, but I found myself pulled into the fray, especially when challenges were dropped by legends like w1z4rd, 5c0r7, r3s0lv3r, and Unpasswd. Their creations had a magnetic pull; solving them was never just work‚Äîit was a thrill, a mental sparring match where every win made me feel sharper.

Looking back, the 2024 qualifiers stood apart for two reasons:

**First, the challenge quality and difficulty were on another level.**

Let‚Äôs pause for a second‚ÄîI‚Äôve played my share of CTFs, and I know the difference between a tough challenge and an *excellent* one. Tough doesn‚Äôt just mean hard. The best challenges are the ones that make you *want* to keep grinding away at them, that hook you, make you smile at the cleverness of their design. These qualifiers were packed with exactly that kind of energy. I learned so much, often stumbling in the dark before that lightbulb moment hit. It was stimulating in every sense‚Äîfrustrating and addictive at once.

The final set of Qualification Stage challenges was a highlight in itself: **"HackBack."** One gem after another. Each new task pushed me harder, made me think deeper, and honestly, left me hungry for more. I have to give massive respect to W1z4rd for this cake.

**Second, the qualifiers were solo.**
That changed everything. For the first time, there was no fallback, no one to swap tasks with or cover your blind spots. Everyone was thrown into the deep end alone. It forced a new level of competence‚Äîthere was nowhere to hide, and no category you could safely ignore. Each participant had to adapt, learn, and step out of their comfort zones.

And one more twist:
Unlike previous years, this time we could finally see *how many* Qualification Stage challenges remained. That little detail became a double-edged sword‚Äîit gave hope, but also dialed up the pressure. Each time the count dropped, I felt a surge of motivation‚Ä¶and then the dread of knowing how much more was left.

All these elements combined made the 2024 qualifiers a true rite of passage. I came out of it exhausted, but also exhilarated‚Äîpushed further than I thought possible, and grateful for every moment spent wrestling with those magnificent puzzles.

### Arrival: Entering the Arena

Crossing the threshold of the Palais des Congr√®s (one f*cking time again), I was hit by a rush of adrenaline‚Äîlike stepping into a coliseum before a digital clash. The air crackled with energy; anticipation and tension danced in the atmosphere. Heavyweights from ASIN and CNIN set the stage with rousing speeches, stoking the competitive fire burning in every contender.

There was a round-table introduction‚Äîeach participant called, one by one, to introduce themselves. I listened as others introduced themselves, some voices steady, others hesitant, a few hiding their ambition behind polite words.

Then came my moment. I declared, loud and clear for all to hear: "I'm here to claim first place." Cocky? Maybe. Provocative? Absolutely. But I was all in‚Äîthere was no turning back. I had adopted the [Burn the Boats](https://twominenglish.com/burn-ones-boat/) mindset; the only path was forward.

The cameras rolled. We lined up for the official video session, then grouped for the traditional photo‚Äîfaces all masked with equal parts resolve and nerves. Next, the random seat draw: a curveball that rattled more than a few. There's a strange comfort in being surrounded by teammates, but here, we were forced into the unknown, seated next to potential rivals rather than allies.

No turning back. The gauntlet had been thrown.

### Unleashing Cyber Warfare

#### Battle Prep

Inside the war room, I prepped for battle. Every tool was checked‚Äînotes sorted, VMs spun up, VPS primed, aliases set. Around me, keyboards clattered and screens flickered, but for a brief moment, I shut out the noise. Deep breath. Meditation. A whispered prayer. I replayed past victories in my mind, recalled every late night, each defeat, every sacrifice that brought me to this arena. I was here for a reason, and I was not alone who want this title.

#### üß† Strategy: The Hidden Blade

My strategy was ruthless and deliberate‚Äî**dominate in silence**. While others rushed for early points, I kept my arsenal under wraps, targeting only high-value challenges, careful not to reveal my true strength. My visible score was just a shadow; my real power was cloaked, building a secret cache of 3000 points, biding my time for the perfect moment to surge ahead.

Some might call this approach sneaky, maybe even unsporting‚Äîbut I‚Äôd learned from bitter experience. This was a page straight from Sun Tzu‚Äôs *Art of War*, and even more so from the Mongol generals: always leave the enemy a path to flee‚Äîlure them in, then close the trap. At HackerLab, I‚Äôd become the ghost in the machine‚Äîunseen, unpredictable, unstoppable.

For those who want to dig deeper, the strategy echoes the [Battle of Mohi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mohi) and this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/45mhvi/sun_tzu_said_when_you_surround_an_army_leave_an/?tl=fr) on leaving the enemy a way out, only to bring total defeat.


#### Mastering Time

Cyber battles span 48 hours of relentless intensity. Knowing my cognitive strengths, I abstained from heavy meals and maintained peak performance with strategic breaks and calculated sleep. Experience at Epitech taught me a vital lesson ‚Äî optimal rest enhances speed and accuracy.

And personally, the lighter I feel, the faster I think (not recommended for everyone, especially those with health conditions).

#### üî• Epic Challenges Conquered

Unlike the qualifiers, the finals offered an impressive variety of challenges. I didn‚Äôt just enjoy the brilliant work of w1z4rd, 5c0r7, and r3s0lv3r‚ÄîI was also blown away by the top-tier challenges from h1s0k4, s3nku, and uchiwa, especially in the DFIR category. The addition of boot2root and hardware challenges this year was fantastic and kept things fresh and exciting.

If I had one regret, it was missing the signature challenges from rimd0r ‚Äî his 2023 contributions were outstanding.

#### üî• Epic Players

While the spotlight inevitably falls on the top 10, it‚Äôs easy to overlook the unsung heroes‚Äîthe quiet forces who shape the competition‚Äôs heartbeat. This year, names like Landry, Destiny07, z3nb0b, z1z0u, and Kafui stepped out of the shadows. Their unexpected ‚Äúbloods‚Äù‚Äîthose precious first solves‚Äîcranked up the pressure for everyone, proving that glory can come from anywhere, at any moment. Every challenge they cracked sent ripples through the ranks, making the game more unpredictable, more electric.

But when I think of those who truly left a mark, these are the ones I can‚Äôt forget:

**3st1m3**: The way they stormed in, snatching first blood on both the highest-weighted boot2root and crypto challenges, left me stunned. It wasn‚Äôt just technical brilliance; it was audacity, it was timing. That first moment when their name lit up the scoreboard‚Äîa masterstroke I couldn‚Äôt help but admire.

**w1z0z**: The web challenges have never seen a force like this. It was almost poetic watching w1z0z dance through them, solving nearly every single one. Each blood was a warning shot to the rest of us: some players make the impossible look routine.

**k3ndr1ck**: Steady, relentless, always near the summit. If unpredictability had a champion, it would be k3ndr1ck‚Äîthe one who played at their own tempo, striking fast, always leaving me guessing. They embodied the ‚ÄúNever Let Them Know Your Next Move‚Äù spirit, making every leaderboard refresh a moment of suspense.

**top0n3**: There was something almost surgical about top0n3‚Äôs approach. They zoned in on pwn and reverse engineering like a laser, dismantling challenge after challenge with cool confidence. Their early aces set a tone‚Äîa quiet, intimidating competence that I couldn‚Äôt ignore.

**Leelee22**: I have to admit, Leelee22 surprised me a lot. Time and again, she rose above setbacks, finding blood on challenges that left others‚Äîincluding me‚Äîscratching our heads. Her resilience was inspiring. Watching her fight, I realized some victories are about more than points; they‚Äôre about refusing to back down.

And then came the new faces‚Äîwildcards who rewrote the script:

**Luffy**: Whispers in the chat hinted at a veteran‚Äôs return, and Luffy did not disappoint. For a while, it felt like he was everywhere at once, dominating the board with the cool assurance of someone who‚Äôs seen it all before. The legend proved real, and I watched in awe.

**Hacksmith**: The true dark horse‚Äîquiet, almost invisible until suddenly they weren‚Äôt. Hacksmith‚Äôs speed and focus were almost unnerving, a storm gathering on the horizon. No bravado, no fanfare‚Äîjust results. I knew I was up against a silent threat.

Yet not every story had a happy ending. **Erza** ‚Äî also known as **Lyanna** ‚Äî stood out during qualifiers, the only one bold enough to tackle the toughest web challenge. Her early exit, forced by personal reasons, left an empty spot in the competition. I felt it; the promise of what could have been lingered in the air, a bittersweet reminder that every player brings more than just skill ‚Äî they bring a story, a spirit. I would‚Äôve loved to see more from she.

### üñ§ Confronting My Fears

The specter of past defeat loomed over me like a shadow I couldn‚Äôt shake. As co-president of my campus cybersec association (**Epihack**), the pressure to ‚Äúlead by example‚Äù sometimes felt suffocating. Every decision, every challenge forced me to wrestle with my own insecurities‚Äîmy failures echoed in my mind, making me question if I was truly fit for the role.

There were days I was desperate, lost, and bone-tired. I doubted myself constantly, haunted by the fear of letting everyone down. But in my darkest moments, it was the unwavering commitment of my fellow Epihack members that kept me afloat. Watching them pour their hearts into our shared mission, achieving what sometimes seemed impossible, gave me hope. Their resilience became my lifeline, inspiring me to dig deeper, push harder, and believe‚Äîmaybe for the first time‚Äîthat I could rise above my fears.

### Brotherhood Among Rivals

Even as the competition blazed with intensity, a deeper bond quietly grew among us‚Äîa brotherhood formed through challenge and respect. Rivalries flared, but bitterness never took root. In rare pauses between battles, I found myself laughing with t0p0n3, swapping stories with AriShark, sharing a smile with CyberLord, Luffy, _z3n_b0b, and members of the Epihack legion. Each of us had our own scars, our own motivations, but there was an unspoken connection forged by mutual struggle.

It was in these small moments‚Äîshared jokes, encouragement after setbacks, nods of recognition‚Äîthat I realized how much this experience meant beyond the scoreboard. Even as rivals, we celebrated each other‚Äôs perseverance and grit. That camaraderie became as rewarding as any victory.

### The Final Strike: Victory Seized

The competition‚Äôs climax arrived in a blur‚Äîa crescendo of nerves and adrenaline. As the final minutes slipped away, I tackled one last formidable challenge, pushing through with every ounce of determination left. When my name rose as champion, time seemed to stand still.

I was swept by a wave of emotions: relief, pride, fierce joy, and exhaustion so deep it left me breathless. The moment felt unreal, as if I was outside myself, witnessing a dream I‚Äôd chased for so long finally materialize.

The prizes‚Äî1,000,000 FCFA, OSCP training and certification, and six months of limitless MTN Benin connectivity‚Äîwere dazzling, hard-earned rewards. Yet, what lingered most was the memory of that final triumph, the echo of my name announced to everyone, and the knowledge that in that electrifying instant, I had given everything and emerged victorious.

### Wisdom for Future Warriors

Every champion starts as a hopeful contender, and the journey from beginner to battle-hardened warrior is shaped not only by hard work, but by the tools you carry and the wisdom you gather. If you‚Äôre preparing to step into the arena, here‚Äôs the essential arsenal I‚Äôve built over years of trial, error, and hard-won experience. These aren‚Äôt just technical tricks‚Äîthey‚Äôre the gear that kept me steady when the pressure was on.

#### Essential Arsenal

* **A free VPS (AWS):** Your remote sanctuary. When your own machine falters or you need a safe playground, this is where you go to experiment freely, It can also be useful to run time-consuming tasks, as well as the most resource-intensive ones.
* **Customized cheat sheets:** My secret weapon‚Äîtailored notes, filled with hard-earned insights, ready at a moment‚Äôs notice. They save precious time and clear mental fog when the clock is ticking.
* **Docker for tool isolation:** Especially when wrangling different Python versions or operating systems (Arm, x32 arch, etc ), Docker keeps everything tidy and contained. No more conflicts‚Äîjust clean environments, every time.
* **Pipenv for Python:** Seamless dependency management that keeps your projects running smoothly, so you spend less time troubleshooting and more time solving.
* **Regular VM snapshots:** Think of these as time machines. One wrong command can ruin hours of work‚Äîsnapshots bring peace of mind and let you take bold risks without fear.
* **Bootable USBs for your main ISO:** When you need to reboot, repair, or recover, having your main ISO on a USB is a lifesaver. I never go into battle without it.
* **Auto-launch Termux:** 
* **Time-saving aliases:** Small scripts, big impact. These shortcuts cut through repetitive tasks, giving you more time to focus on what really matters.
* **Autopsy, FTK, Volweb (All on Windows):** Sometimes, these forensic tools change the game entirely. When you hit a wall, they open new doors.
* **[CryptoHack Docker](https://github.com/cryptohack/cryptohack-docker):** An absolute game-changer for tackling crypto challenges‚Äîstreamlined, reliable, and ready to go.

#### üóì Year-long Preparation:

Preparation for a competition like this is more than just a checklist‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey, a year-long odyssey that tests your discipline, curiosity, and resolve. I learned to prepare methodically: pouring over write-ups from past challenges, refining my own notes late into the night, making sure my tools were razor-sharp, and, perhaps most importantly, facing my own limits with honesty. Combating impostor syndrome became a part of my routine; every doubt was a hurdle to clear, every small breakthrough a quiet victory.

If you‚Äôve been pushing yourself hard all year, trust me‚Äîthere‚Äôs real wisdom in taking a breather before the final test. I found that stepping back for two weeks before the competition made all the difference. I used that time not to cram, but to breathe, to re-read my notes, to gently revisit those concepts that had always felt just out of reach. The anxiety faded, replaced by clarity and renewed confidence.

In those last quiet days before the storm, I rediscovered why I started in the first place‚Äîthe thrill of solving, the joy of learning, the satisfaction of growth. When the competition finally arrived, I wasn‚Äôt just prepared; I was centered and truly ready. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôd urge anyone to do, it‚Äôs this: respect the journey, and give yourself the gift of a little peace before the final battle. You‚Äôll feel the difference when it matters most.

### Final Reflections

**HackerLab 2024 was more than just a contest‚Äîit was an odyssey.** Beyond mere technical prowess, it demanded resilience, adaptability, and unwavering determination. I was forced to dig deep, not just to solve challenges, but to outlast stress and turn chaos into focus. Next time, I‚Äôll be even sharper‚Äîready to manage stress, set priorities, and attack smarter.

This wasn‚Äôt simply a race for points; it was a battle for glory. It pushed me to my limits‚Äîand then far beyond. I walk away transformed, with scars and lessons that will forge victories in future local and international arenas.

I still remember the feeling when I saw the final scoreboard‚Äîa mix of confusion, a sense of ‚ÄúI deserve this, after all,‚Äù relief that it was finally over, and that odd emptiness of ‚Äúwhat goal do I chase next?‚Äù All those thoughts collided in my head at once, leaving me both satisfied and a little lost.

**Immense gratitude to ASIN and every comrade who supported me on this journey** ‚Äî especially **3st1m3**, with whom it all began three years ago. Your encouragement and camaraderie fueled every breakthrough.
